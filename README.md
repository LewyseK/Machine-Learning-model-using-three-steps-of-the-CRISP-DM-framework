# Machine-Learning-model-using-three-steps-of-the-CRISP-DM-framework
This is an ML model using the dollar tree data set.
It goes through the business understanding, data understanding and data preprocessing stages of the CRISP-DM framework.
The process also involves answering key questions such as: 
1.)Contribution to Revenue by Product Category.
2.)Which Product and Sub Category has the highest counts?
3.)What are the percentages for Product Category?
4.)What are the percentages for Males and Females?
5.)How many countries do we have?
The data is then split for training and testing.
Finally, four models are used to train and predict.
